        <h1 class="heading-xlarge">Bangladeshi</h1>

        <p>The Bangladeshi ethnic group made up 0.8% of the <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/ethnicity-in-the-uk/population-by-ethnicity">population of England and Wales</a> in 2011; this is an increase from 0.5% in 2001. Data from the latest 3-year APS dataset (2013-2015) estimates that around 61% of Bangladeshis in England and Wales were born outside the UK.</p>

        <p>Almost 50% of Bangladeshis <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/ethnicity-in-the-uk/ethnic-groups-by-region">lived in London</a> at the time of the last Census. Around 1 in 8 Bangladeshis lived in the West Midlands and 1 in 10 lived in the North West.</p>

        <p>A quarter of Bangladeshis in 2011 were categorised as ‘never worked or long-term unemployed’ with Bangladeshi women more likely to be in this category than Bangladeshi men (51% compared with 28%). Just 4.2% were categorised as <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/ethnicity-in-the-uk/ethnic-groups-by-economic-status">‘higher managerial, administrative, or professional’</a> the lowest of all ethnic groups.</p>

        <p>43% of Bangladeshi HRPs lived in a married couple household with dependent children and 16% lived in ‘other’ household types (for example, multi-generational) with dependent children.</p>

        <p>People from a Bangladeshi ethnic background were the group most likely to not speak English well, or at all (16.2%). The Bangladeshi ethnic group had the highest percentage of girls and women with poor <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/culture-and-community/community/english-language-skills/latest">English language skills</a>, at 21.9%; this compares with 10.8% of Bangladeshi boys and men. Almost 45% of Bangladeshi women aged 65 and over (3,500 people) couldn’t speak English, making them the single group of people most likely to be unable to do so.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">Crime</h2>

        <p>In 9 of the last 10 years, the Bangladeshi group had the highest <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/crime-justice-and-the-law/policing/stop-and-search/latest">stop&nbsp;and&nbsp;search</a> rate of all Asian groups. The rate increased between 2006/07 and 2010/11 (from 26.3 per 1,000 population to 63.5) before decreasing substantially between 2010/11 and 2015/16 (to 15.9 per 1,000 population). However, the stop and search rate of the Bangladeshi group in 2015/16 was 4 times that of the White British group.</p>

        <p>In 2015/16, almost a third of Bangladeshi adults expressed a fear of crime, a higher proportion than that of adults in the White British, White Irish, Other White, Mixed White and Black Caribbean, or Chinese ethnic groups.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">Housing</h2>

        <p>Around 2 in 5 (39%) Bangladeshi households <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/housing/owning-and-renting/home-ownership/latest">owned their own home</a>, a lower proportion than for White British (68%), Indian (68%) and Pakistani households (64%).</p>

        <p>Bangladeshi households were by far the most likely of all Asian ethnic groups to be living in <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/housing/owning-and-renting/time-spent-living-in-current-home/latest">social housing</a> at 42%. This compares with 7% of Indian households and 16% of White British households. Around 2% of White British households experienced <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/housing/housing-conditions/overcrowded-households/latest">overcrowding</a> compared with 30% of Bangladeshi households (the highest percentage of all ethnic groups).</p>

        <p>For almost all ethnic groups the most likely <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/housing/social-housing/routes-into-social-housing/latest">route into social housing</a> was through the tenant applying directly; however, for Bangladeshi households the most likely route into social housing was being by being nominated by a local housing authority - 39%.</p>

        <p>For almost all ethnic groups, the most likely reason that a tenant was given priority for a <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/housing/social-housing/new-social-housing-lettings/latest">new social housing letting</a> was due to homelessness; however, for Bangladeshi households, the most likely reason was currently living in insanitary, unsatisfactory or overcrowded conditions, at 48%.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">Health and well-being</h2>

        <p>The Bangladeshi ethnic group reported lower than average levels of <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/health/physical-and-mental-health/well-being-how-worthwhile-people-feel-the-things-they-do-in-their-life-are/latest">feeling their activities were worthwhile</a> – 7.65 out of 10, compared to a national average of 7.85 out of 10. However, women from the Bangladeshi ethnic group were more likely to feel their activities were worthwhile than their male counterparts (7.90 for women compared to 7.52 for men).</p>

        <p>The percentage of Bangladeshi children aged 4 to 5 who were <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/health/preventing-illness/overweight-children/latest">overweight</a> was significantly lower than the 22.1% national average at 20.3% in 2015/16. However, the percentage of Bangladeshi children aged 10 to 11 who were overweight was significantly higher than the 34.2% national average, at 42.7%.</p>

        <p>The percentage of Bangladeshis reporting a <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/health">positive experience of making a GP appointment</a> decreased between 2011/12 and 2016/17 from 66.1% to 58.9% (which is lower than the national average of 72.2%). Similarly, Bangladeshi patients were among the least likely to report a <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/health/patient-experiences/patient-experience-of-primary-care-gp-services/latest">positive experience of GP services</a> (73.7% in 2015/16).</p>

        <p><a href="#">IAPT (Improving Access to Psychological Therapies) referrals</a> for patients in the Bangladeshi group were one of the least likely to have shown improvement (for both men and women). Nearly 11% of referrals for Bangladeshi patients showed deterioration – the highest percentage for any ethnic group.</p>

        <p>Hospital inpatients of Bangladeshi background had the lowest <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/health/patient-experiences/inpatient-satisfaction-with-hospital-care/latest">satisfaction score</a> of any ethnic group in 2016/17 and were among the least satisfied with hospital care in each of the 4 years covered (2013/14 to 2016/17).</p>

        <p>In 2016/17 for the Bangladeshi group, there were 107.6 <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/health/access-to-treatment/detentions-under-the-mental-health-act/latest">detentions under the Mental Health Act</a> per 100,000 population, compared with 64.3 per 100,000 population for the White British group.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">Education</h2>

        <p>Bangladeshi pupils in 2015/16 showed similar patterns of educational achievement, achieving as well as, or better than, White British pupils in all Key Stages and across most subjects.</p>

        <p>In KS1, the percentage of Bangladeshi pupils meeting the expected and higher standards in <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/education-skills-and-training/5-to-7-years-old/phonics-attainments-for-children-aged-5-to-7-key-stage-1/latest">phonics</a>, <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/education-skills-and-training/5-to-7-years-old/reading-attainments-for-children-aged-5-to-7-key-stage-1/latest">reading</a>, <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/education-skills-and-training/5-to-7-years-old/writing-attainments-for-children-aged-5-to-7-key-stage-1/latest">writing</a> and <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/education-skills-and-training/5-to-7-years-old/mathematics-attainments-for-children-aged-5-to-7-key-stage-1/latest">maths</a> was similar to the percentage of White British pupils. For example, 69% of Bangladeshi KS1 pupils met the expected standard in writing compared with 66% of White British KS1 pupils. Only in <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/education-skills-and-training/5-to-7-years-old/science-attainments-for-children-aged-5-to-7-key-stage-1/latest">science</a> was there a higher percentage of White British pupils than Bangladeshi pupils achieving the expected standard (84% of White British compared with 79% of Bangladeshi).</p>

        <p>Even so, in all subjects, Bangladeshi pupils eligible for free school meals substantially outperformed their White British counterparts. Over two-thirds (64%) of FSM-eligible KS1 Bangladeshi pupils met the expected standard in writing compared with less than half (47%) of FSM-eligible KS1 White British pupils (a difference of 17 percentage points).</p>

        <p>At KS2, a higher percentage of Bangladeshi pupils than White British pupils met both the expected and higher standards in all subjects except <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/education-skills-and-training/7-to-11-years-old/reading-attainments-for-children-aged-7-to-11-key-stage-2/latest">reading</a>. For example, 81% of KS2 Bangladeshi pupils met the expected standard in <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/education-skills-and-training/7-to-11-years-old/grammar-punctuation-and-spelling-attainment-for-children-aged-7-to-11-key-stage-2/latest">‘grammar, punctuation and spelling’</a> compared with 72% of KS2 White British pupils. In all subjects Bangladeshi pupils showed more progress on average than White British pupils (for example a progress score of 0.3 for Bangladeshi pupils in reading compared with -0.1 for White British pupils).</p>

        <p>The differences between FSM-eligible pupils are also evident at KS2. Over half (52%) of FSM-eligible Bangladeshi pupils met the expected standard in <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/education-skills-and-training/7-to-11-years-old/reading-writing-and-maths-attainments-for-children-aged-7-to-11-key-stage-2/latest">‘reading, writing and maths’</a> compared with less than a third (32%) of FSM-eligible White British pupils (a difference of 20 percentage points).</p>

        <p>In KS4 in 2015/16, Bangladeshi pupils also outperformed White British pupils. Bangladeshi pupils had a higher average Attainment 8 score (52 compared with 50), Progress 8 score (0.33 compared with -0.11) and percentage achieving grades A*-C in English and Maths GCSEs (67% compared with 63%) than White British pupils. Again, this difference was even greater between Bangladeshi and White British pupils eligible for free school meals; for example 61% of FSM-eligible Bangladesh pupils attained A*-C in English and Maths GCSEs compared with 34% of White British FSM-eligible pupils.</p>

        <p>In 2014/15 after both KS4 and KS5, a higher percentage of Bangladeshi pupils went on to sustained education than White British pupils (94% compared with 90% after KS4, 79% compared with 62% after KS5). However, of pupils taking A Levels in 2016, just 6% of Bangladeshi pupils achieved 3 A grades or better, compared with 11% of White British pupils.</p>

        <p>In 2015/16, Bangladeshi pupils had rates of <a hred="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/education-skills-and-training/absence-and-exclusions/absence-from-school/latest">absence and persistent absence</a> from school that we comparable with White British pupils. The rate of <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/education-skills-and-training/absence-and-exclusions/pupil-exclusions/latest">fixed and permanent exclusions</a> for Bangladeshi pupils was lower than the rate for White British pupils.</p>

        <p>There were around 2,300 <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/work-pay-and-benefits/public-sector-workforce/school-teacher-workforce/latest">teachers</a> of Bangladeshi background in England in 2016, making up 0.5% of the teacher workforce. Of head teachers, 0.1% were Bangladeshi.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">Labour Market, Income and Benefits</h2>

        <p>Employment estimates are only available for the Bangladeshi and Pakistani groups combined.</p>

        <p>In 2016, the combined Bangladeshi and Pakistani group had the lowest <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/work-pay-and-benefits/employment/employment/latest">employment rate</a> of all ethnic groups, at 54%; this compares with 75% for the White British group. The Bangladeshi/Pakistani rate has increased from 44% in 2004. Around 72% of Bangladeshi/Pakistani men were employed compared with 35% of Bangladeshi/Pakistani women.</p>

        <p>The group with the highest <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/work-pay-and-benefits/unemployment-and-economic-inactivity/unemployment/latest">rate of unemployment</a> in 2016 (and for most of the previous 12 years) was the Pakistani/Bangladeshi group (11%). This compares with 4% for the White British group.</p>

        <p>The Pakistani/Bangladeshi group had the highest <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/work-pay-and-benefits/unemployment-and-economic-inactivity/economic-inactivity/latest">economic inactivity</a> rate (39%), 18 percentage points higher than the White British group. However, this has decreased from 49% in 2004.</p>

        <p>The Pakistani/Bangladeshi group had the highest economic inactivity rate for women (59%) and had the biggest gap between men (21%) and women, at 38 percentage points.</p>

        <p>Bangladeshi households consistently had the lowest percentage of <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/work-pay-and-benefits/pay-and-income/sources-of-household-income/latest">income coming from employment</a>, although the percentage increased from 60% in the three years 2009/10 to 2011/12 to 64% in the three years 2013/14 to 2015/16. Furthermore, Bangladeshi households received the highest percentage of income from benefits and tax credits, during this period, ranging from 24% to 27%.</p>

        <p>Bangladeshi family units were the most likely to receive both a type of <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/work-pay-and-benefits/benefits/state-support/latest">tax credit</a> (30% did so) and a type of income-related benefit (32%). They were also the most likely to receive child benefit (35%).</p>

        <p>Around 32% of Bangladeshi households had a <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/work-pay-and-benefits/pay-and-income/household-income/latest">weekly income</a> of £400 or less, the same percentage as White British households. However, 28% of Bangladeshi households had weekly income over £800 compared with 35% of White British households.</p>

        <p>Since 2013, the average <a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/work-pay-and-benefits/pay-and-income/average-hourly-pay/latest">hourly pay</a> of Indian employees has tended to be the highest out of all ethnic groups, while the average hourly pay of Pakistani and Bangladeshi employees has tended to be the lowest</p>
